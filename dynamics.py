# Momentum is conserved when the total initial momentum is equal to the total final momentum of a system.
# Elastic collision is a collision such that no energy is lost to the surrounding.

# Write a function for an elastic collision, that takes in the masses and the initial velocities of two bodies , and return the respective final velocities of the two bodies.
